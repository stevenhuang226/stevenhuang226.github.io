	<h1>My Story</h1>
	<div>
		<h6>The reason why I learn python</h6>
		<a>When I was 6th grade in elementary school. My dad gave me a book, which is about how to start lean coding with python. Because I  interested in computer, I started learn python.</a>

		<h6>The first day I switch to Linux</h6>
		<a>
			Because the laptop I was using is pretty old. It cannot display websites smoothly any more. Then I heard that linux can safe more power, and run more effectively. So I decided to swithc to Linux. Cause I didn't have any knowledge about Linux, I just choosed the most famous one, Ubuntu
		</a>
		<a>
			Everything was smoothly when install. But after the first reboot after installation, I observed that wifi and bluetooth didn't work. Then I started search the driver for my wireless card. I found that maybe I cannot solve this problem by myself, so I called my dad for help. I still remember the day me and my dad sit on the ground close router for many hours to solve the driver problem.

		<h6>I use arch btw</h6>
		<a>
			After switch to Ubuntu for 2 years, I feel there is too many limiteds to me to configure my system. So I started finding another linux distort as next operation system for daily usage. Because I saw too many meme about arch, and heard arch has more captivity for customize. So I choosed arch linux as my new operation system to use and learn.
			When I got the new laptop ( the one I'm using right now ), I confused about due boot or arch only. Because there still some service and free software for few months, I decided to leave Windows.
			At first I wanted to try install without arch-install tool ( python script to help you install in gui-liked interface ), than I failed. There was too many thing I need to learn about the linux kernel and hardware.
			Even though the first try failed, I come to second chance very quick. Because I broke my whole system, I need to reinstall it from scratch to fix the problem. I have no idea how I success when second try to install by hand instead arch-install script. Although I just copy what people do in video, but it still help me a lot to learn how linux work.
